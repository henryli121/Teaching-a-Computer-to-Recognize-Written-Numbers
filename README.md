# Teaching-a-Computer-to-Recognize-Written-Numbers
This project uses wavelet decomposition, singular value decomposition (SVD), and linear discrimination analysis (LDA) to teach a computer to recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy (99.72% for 0 and 1, and 94% for all 10 digits). SVMs provided the best overall accuracy at 98%.
